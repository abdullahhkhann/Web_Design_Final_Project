# Web_Design_Final_Project
We are two university students that are studying in <a href = "https://www.adu.ac.ae/"> Abu Dhabi University, Abu dhabi(ADU).</a> 
Our names are Muhammad Abdullah Khan, 1075677, and Hussein Ali Jameel, 1074817, and we both are software engineers.
We both are finishing our 2nd year. I, Abdullah Khan, am from Pakistan and I'm 18 years old. My partner, Hussein Jameel, is from
Iraq and is 19 years old. We both spent our time making this project as perfect as possible to the top of our abilities.
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code this website. Our website consists of a main page that contains links to our other webpages.
I developed the HTML and CSS code for the main page. I then developed the HTML code that consists JavaScript elements in it too for the
'Sign up/Log in' page along with a separate CSS file. My partner then developed the HTML and CSS code for the 'Online Reservations' page.
My parner the developed the rest of the webpages while I checked them and fixed the errors of the code while making it neater and
fixing the design like I am coding the code for this web page and telling you more about us and how we put this project together, while
my partner created most of the CSS. It was a great experience creating this project and great fun. I hope you enjoyed the process as much as we did!!
